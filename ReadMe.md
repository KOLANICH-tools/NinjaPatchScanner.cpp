[`Ninja` build system](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) relies on external scanners to provide info on the files generated by build process. These files are mentioned in [so called `dyndep` files](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#_tarball_extraction) (I don't think the name is a good one). These files are supposed to be generated by external tools.

This is the tool to generate dyndef files for the files modified by patch files.

It uses https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH-libs/ParsePatch.cpp library to parse patch file. In order to build this tool you need to install it.
